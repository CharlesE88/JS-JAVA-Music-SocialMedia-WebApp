            <div class="bandBio">
            <p>Robert Anthony Plant was born on August 20, 1948, in Bromwich, Staffordshire, England. Robert Plant became interested in singing at a young age and found inspiration in the likes of Elvis Presley. In 1966, Plant left school to began his musical career. He performed with a number of groups around this time, showing his talent for handling blues music. With drummer John "Bonzo" Bonham, Plant formed Band of Joy. In 1968, Plant was recruited by guitarist Jimmy Page for the New Yardbirds, and he, in turn, recommended Bonham to Page. The fourth member of the group was bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones.</p>
