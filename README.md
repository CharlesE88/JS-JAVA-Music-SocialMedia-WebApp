# JS-JAVA-Music-SocialMedia-WebApp
Created for WEB401. The app lets the user search for band and artist info from a database. The app lets users add information that can't be found. The app also lets the user hear snippets of songs from the bands. This was done in Java which was one of the main requirements for the assignment. Most of the students for the class built a portfolio website and some built shopping sites. I was the only one to build a standalone Social Media site. The app also lets the user download the data that has been collected. (Data collection script not added, "DUE TO LEGALITY ISSUES, SINCE THE SCRIPT CAN BE USED FOR BAD INTENT").
